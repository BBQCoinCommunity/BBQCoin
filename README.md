# **What is BBQCoin?**
BBQCoin was created during the early days of cryptocurrency as a lighthearted project with a unique concept: to bring the barbecue spirit into the blockchain world. Its launch in 2012 marked it as one of the pioneering memecoins, alongside other early crypto experiments. The projectâ€™s blockchain has remained intact, preserving every transaction from block 1 onward, making BBQCoin a living piece of crypto history. This preservation underscores its commitment to transparency and its deep connection to the roots of blockchain technology.
